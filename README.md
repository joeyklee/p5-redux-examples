- [ex01-counter](/ex01-counter): add and remove squares using buttons. Very similar to  https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/counter-vanilla
	- [code](/ex01-counter)
 	- [demo](https://joeyklee.github.io/p5-redux-examples/ex01-counter)
- [ex02-sorting](/ex02-sorting): Builds off ex01 but adds sorting of filled squares based on their hue, saturation, and brightness. Shows how you can affect the state of objects in an array.
