# P5 + Redux examples

A collection of sketches to demo using Redux for state management of a p5.js application.

## Index

- [ex01-counter](/ex01-counter): add and remove squares using buttons. Very similar to  https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/counter-vanilla
- [ex02-sorting](/ex02-sortig): Builds off ex01 but adds sorting of filled squares based on their hue, saturation, and brightness. Shows how you can affect the state of objects in an array.
